_Theme requirements:_ The project focuses on the development of a system of laboratory robots for the automated management of warehouses, consisting of a main robot, equipped with a robotic arm, and a transport robot, which collaborates for to take over and transport the goods to the warehouse.

_Selected solutions:_ Motor speed control, inverse kinematics for the robotic arm, WiFi communication between robots.

_Results obtained:_ A system of 2 robots capable of moving to coordinates given by the user and manipulating the robotic arm from a web interface.

_Testing and verifications:_ During the development of the project, we divided it into smaller modules. Each module has been tested and validated individually to ensure functionality. This approach allowed identifying and solving problems more effectively.

_Personal contributions:_ Identification and calculation of a PID regulator for the robot speed control system, calculation of the inverse kinematics model of the robotic arm, communication between robots and the user through the web interface.

_Documentation sources:_ Scientific articles, conferences, specialized websites.
